## Introduction

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains several health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and more. By applying different supervised learning algorithms, we can predict the onset of diabetes with reasonable accuracy.

The goal is to explore and compare multiple algorithms to find the best fit for this classification problem.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DiabetesDetectionModel.git
   cd DiabetesDetectionModel ```

2. **Install required libraries:**

It's recommended to create a virtual environment first:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
 ```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
In the Jupyter interface, open the DiabetesDetection.ipynb notebook to run the project.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the diabetes dataset (e.g., from the Pima Indians dataset). This dataset should be loaded in the notebook.
2. Run the cells to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
   
In the notebook, you'll find steps such as:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature selection
* Applying multiple supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
* Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
* Comparison of model performance

## Model Performance
The following algorithms were tested and evaluated for diabetes prediction:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. The best-performing model can be selected based on these evaluations.
